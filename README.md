## Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This repository contains two Python scripts: `customer_main.py` and `random500_data.py`.

### 1. `customer_main.py`
`customer_main.py` performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. It processes customer data to identify distinct customer segments based on two key features: `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`

#### Steps in `customer_main.py`:
1. **Loading the Dataset**: 
   - The dataset `customers.csv` is read into a pandas DataFrame. It should be in the same directory as the script.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The script selects two features (`Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`) for clustering.
   - Standardizes the data using `StandardScaler` to ensure proper scaling for K-Means.

3. **Optimal Cluster Determination**:
   - Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by evaluating the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

4. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Applies K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters (5, based on the Elbow Method).
   - The predicted cluster labels are added to the dataset as a new column (`Cluster`).

5. **Visualization**:
   - A scatter plot is generated to visualize the customer segments with color-coded clusters.
   - The centroids of the clusters are marked in red with an "X".

#### How to Run:
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. Ensure the file `customers.csv` is available in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python customer_main.py
   ```

4. The script will generate:
   - An elbow plot for determining the optimal number of clusters.
   - A scatter plot showing the customer segmentation with marked centroids.

### 2. `random500_data.py`
`random500_data.py` generates a synthetic dataset with 500 customer records, including random values for `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`

#### Steps in `random500_data.py`:
1. **Generate Random Data**:
   - Randomly generates `Annual Income (k$)` values between 10K and 150K.
   - Randomly generates `Spending Score (1-100)` values for each customer.

2. **Save to CSV**:
   - The generated data is saved into a CSV file called `customers.csv` that can be used by `customer_main.py` for segmentation.

#### How to Run:
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python random500_data.py
   ```

3. The script will generate a `customers.csv` file in the same directory with 500 random customer records.

### Notes:
- The `customers.csv` file generated by `random500_data.py` will be used as input for `customer_main.py`.
- Modify the `optimal_clusters` variable in `customer_main.py` to adjust the number of clusters based on the Elbow Method output.
